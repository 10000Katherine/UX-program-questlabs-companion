## 📊 Data Analysis Framework

### After collecting 15+ responses, analyze for:

**1. Segmentation:**

- Active reflectors vs. Aspirational reflectors
- Tool users vs. Non-users
- Social vs. Independent types

**2. Key Metrics to Report:**

- X% reflect less than weekly → validates "habit formation" problem
- X% prefer under 2-min interaction → validates quick check-in design
- X% interested in visual tracking (rating 4-5) → validates dashboard priority
- X% want structured prompts → validates fill-in-the-blank approach
- X% comfortable with aggregated peer data → validates privacy-first cohort design

**3. Qualitative Gold:**

- Quote 2-3 compelling open-ended responses
- Identify unexpected pain points
- Find language users actually use (not our jargon)

---

## 🎯 Modern Survey Best Practices Applied

**✅ Progressive disclosure**: Split into logical sections with clear progress bar
**✅ Mobile-optimized**: Short questions, minimal typing
**✅ Mixed question types**: Multiple choice (fast) + rating scales (quantifiable) + open-ended (depth)
**✅ Logic branching**: Skip irrelevant questions (e.g., "why did you stop" only for ex-users)
**✅ Respectful of time**: Target 4-5 min, show estimated time upfront
**✅ Inclusive language**: Gender-neutral, accessible, no assumptions
**✅ Incentive consideration**: Offer to share results (reciprocity)
**✅ Data privacy note**: Add at top: "Responses are anonymous and used only for academic research"

**Subject**: Research Collaboration Inquiry - QuestLabs Companion App Survey

```
Dear Makēda,

My name is Dong Zhang, and I'm a UX design student at Douglas College. I've been researching QuestLabs as part of a course project where we're designing a companion app to support students in personal development cohort programs like yours.

I'm conducting user research to understand how students engage with goal tracking, emotional reflection, and peer accountability—key elements I've seen in QuestLabs' "Me-Search, We-Search, Re-Search" framework.

**Would you be open to:**
1. Sharing a brief survey (5 min) with past QuestLabs participants?
2. Or connecting me with students who might be interested in providing feedback?

Survey link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecelozNUqU-wZzHfmVYWwrKLkcN-iYRBxQTutOt5N7o5qchw/viewform

The insights will help ensure our design honors the values of QuestLabs—privacy, collaboration over competition, and structured reflection. I'd be happy to share the final design with you as well.

Thank you for your incredible work with QuestLabs, and for considering this request!

Best regards,
