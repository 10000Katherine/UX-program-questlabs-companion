## 🎯 What is QuestLabs Companion?

QuestLabs Companion is a mobile application designed specifically for college students in cohort-based personal development programs. Unlike traditional productivity or wellness apps, we integrate three critical dimensions of student life:

- **Emotional Wellness** - Track and understand your emotional patterns
- **Relational Quality** - Monitor and improve relationships
- **Academic Progress** - Connect daily actions to long-term goals

### 💡 Our Philosophy

**"From present awareness to future possibilities—together."**

We believe personal growth happens through:
- ✅ **Structured reflection** (not overwhelming flexibility)
- ✅ **Small trusted communities** (not anonymous crowds)
- ✅ **Collaborative support** (not competitive gamification)
- ✅ **Daily micro-habits** (not time-consuming routines)

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### What Makes Us Different

| Aspect | Traditional Apps | QuestLabs Companion |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Single dimension (mood OR tasks) | Holistic integration (emotional + relational + academic) |
| **Community** | Anonymous or competitive | Small known groups (5-10 students) |
| **Time Required** | 5-15 minutes daily | <2 minutes daily |
| **Approach** | Gamification & points | Collaborative growth |
| **Privacy** | Share everything or nothing | Aggregated, privacy-preserving |

### Design Principles

1. **Quick & Structured** - Under 2 minutes daily, guided prompts
2. **Privacy-Preserving** - Inspired by Strava's social model
3. **Anti-Gamification** - No points or competition
4. **Mobile-First** - Designed for interrupted contexts
5. **Cohort-Based** - Small trusted groups, not anonymous masses

## 🏗️ PACT Framework Analysis

**Primary Users:** College students (18-30 years old)
- In structured personal development programs
