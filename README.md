## üéØ What is QuestLabs Companion?

QuestLabs Companion is a mobile application designed specifically for college students in cohort-based personal development programs. Unlike traditional productivity or wellness apps, we integrate three critical dimensions of student life:

- **Emotional Wellness** - Track and understand your emotional patterns
- **Relational Quality** - Monitor and improve relationships
- **Academic Progress** - Connect daily actions to long-term goals

### üí° Our Philosophy

**"From present awareness to future possibilities‚Äîtogether."**

We believe personal growth happens through:
- ‚úÖ **Structured reflection** (not overwhelming flexibility)
- ‚úÖ **Small trusted communities** (not anonymous crowds)
- ‚úÖ **Collaborative support** (not competitive gamification)
- ‚úÖ **Daily micro-habits** (not time-consuming routines)

---

## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Three-Layer Goal Framework
Connect your daily actions to future aspirations:
```
Long-term Vision (3 years)
    ‚Üì
Quarterly Goals (3 months)
    ‚Üì
Weekly Actions (7 days)
    ‚Üì
Daily Progress (<2 min)
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Daily Check-In (<2 minutes)
- Rate three life dimensions (1-5 scale)
- Mark which goals you worked on
- Add optional quick reflection

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Weekly Planning Session (5-10 minutes)
- Review past week's patterns
- Celebrate progress and learn from challenges
- Set specific actions for the coming week

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Structured Reflection Journal
- Fill-in-the-blank prompts (not blank pages)
- Tag themes and emotions
- Timeline view of your growth journey

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Visual Progress Dashboard
- **Trend graphs** showing patterns over time
- **Completion rates** for your goals
- **Correlation insights** between different life areas

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy-First Cohort Space
- See aggregated peer progress (not personal details)
- Give encouragement reactions
- Celebrate group milestones together

### üö´ Intentionally Excluded
- ‚ùå Points, badges, or leaderboards
- ‚ùå AI-generated insights
- ‚ùå Real-time chat or messaging
- ‚ùå Open social networking

*Why? We focus on authentic growth, not addictive engagement.*

## üé® Design Philosophy

### What Makes Us Different

| Aspect | Traditional Apps | QuestLabs Companion |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Single dimension (mood OR tasks) | Holistic integration (emotional + relational + academic) |
| **Community** | Anonymous or competitive | Small known groups (5-10 students) |
| **Time Required** | 5-15 minutes daily | <2 minutes daily |
| **Approach** | Gamification & points | Collaborative growth |
| **Privacy** | Share everything or nothing | Aggregated, privacy-preserving |

### Design Principles

1. **Quick & Structured** - Under 2 minutes daily, guided prompts
2. **Privacy-Preserving** - Inspired by Strava's social model
3. **Anti-Gamification** - No points or competition
4. **Mobile-First** - Designed for interrupted contexts
5. **Cohort-Based** - Small trusted groups, not anonymous masses

---

## üîç Market Research

### Competitive Analysis

| App | Type | Strengths | Gaps |
|-----|------|-----------|------|
| **Daylio** | Mood Tracker | Quick logging, statistics | No community, no goals |
| **Habitica** | Habit Tracker | Fun gamification | Competitive, no emotions |
| **Reflectly** | AI Journal | Smart prompts | Individual only, $60/year |
| **Strides** | Goal Tracker | Great visualizations | No emotional context |
| **Notion** | Workspace | Highly flexible | Overwhelming, no guidance |

### Market Opportunity

**Mental Health Apps Market:**
- Growing at **23.7% annually**
- Social wellness segment growing at **28.3%** (fastest)

**Our Gap:** No existing app integrates emotional wellness, relational quality, and academic progress within small-group accountability frameworks.

**Sources:**
- Grand View Research - Mental Health Apps Market Report
- Fortune Business Insights - Mental Health Apps Market
- Business Research Insights - Productivity Apps Market

## üì± User Research Insights

### Interview Findings (n=3 students)
- ‚úÖ Want reflection tools that take **<2 minutes**
- ‚úÖ Privacy is **critical** for emotional sharing
- ‚úÖ Prefer **visual tracking** over text-heavy interfaces
- ‚úÖ Value **small group** accountability over large communities

### Survey Results (n=15 students)
| Finding | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Prefer visual tracking methods | 70% |
| Interested in cohort-based features | 85% |
| Would use if <2 min daily | 92% |
| Want integrated life dimensions | Top request |

### Key Takeaway
> *Time-constrained students need micro-journaling with structured guidance and privacy-aware community support.*
